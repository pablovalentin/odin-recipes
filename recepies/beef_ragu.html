    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Beef ragu—a traditional Italian dish—is a slow-simmered sauce made with
      beef, tomatoes, pasta, etc. Many newer ragu recipes use sambal oelek or
      anchovy paste to help build flavor, so I've used harissa, but feel free to
      replace with 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper or 1 teaspoon fennel seeds or
      omit. If you like you can add rosemary sprigs to the sauce as it simmers.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil/li></li>
      <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons harissa (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 pound pappardelle pasta, cooked and drained</li>
      <li>grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Season chuck roast with
        pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Sear meat until browned on every side,
        working in batches if necessary, about 10 minutes. Remove from Dutch
        oven and transfer to a large plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, stirring often, until
        softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly,
        until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and tomato paste; cook,
        stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden
        spoon to loosen any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds, about 5
        minutes. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1
        teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors
        meld, about 2 1/2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting
        board and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in
        pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
